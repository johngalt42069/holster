## Manufacturing guidelines

If using FDM printer recommend use PAHT-CF or some other Nylon for all parts except the QLS fork, which should be made out of TPU95.
Make sure layer lines are positioned correctly.

If you want to make these parts out of metal the QLS fork needs material removed since metal is not as flexible.

I am not responsible for any injuries from misuse or improper manufacturing.
